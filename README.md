# **People-centric Traffic Hotspot Identification and Characterization Based on Social Media Data**

This repository presents the project description and codes for the traffic hotspot analysis. 

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we want to identify and characterize the traffic hotspots based on social media data.

The **research questions** are as follows:

- Could social media data be used to find the traffic hotspots?
  - How to detect the accident hotspots and congestion hotspots based on traffic-related social media?
  - How the accident and congestion hotspots spatially distribute in the city?
  - What is the correlation between the accident hotspot and congestion hotspot detected by social media and actual traffic accident and congestion records?

- Where (route/intersection/expressway/etc) people are most discussed in the accident hotspot and the congestion hotspot? Which hotspot areas should be prioritized for the following traffic management?

The **main contributions** of this study are:

- We use a new data source, social media data, to detect and characterize the accident and congestion hotspots from peopleâ€™s perspectives. 
- We modify the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approach to identify the people-centric traffic hotspots, by incorporating the sentiment information of traffic-relevant microblogs. The detected hotspot is further compared with the traditional KDE method.
- We further provide insights into the traffic accidents and congestions in Shanghai and offer policy recommendations for future traffic management.
